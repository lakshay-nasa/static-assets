## Technical Reference Guide

The sections above provide an overview of how to use this entity. The following sections provide detailed technical information about how metadata is stored and represented in DataHub.

**Aspects** are the individual pieces of metadata that can be attached to an entity. Each aspect contains specific information (like ownership, tags, or properties) and is stored as a separate record, allowing for flexible and incremental metadata updates.

**Relationships** show how this entity connects to other entities in the metadata graph. These connections are derived from the fields within each aspect and form the foundation of DataHub's knowledge graph.

### Reading the Field Tables

Each aspect's field table includes an **Annotations** column that provides additional metadata about how fields are used:

- **⚠️ Deprecated**: This field is deprecated and may be removed in a future version. Check the description for the recommended alternative
- **Searchable**: This field is indexed and can be searched in DataHub's search interface
- **Searchable (fieldname)**: When the field name in parentheses is shown, it indicates the field is indexed under a different name in the search index. For example, `dashboardTool` is indexed as `tool`
- **→ RelationshipName**: This field creates a relationship to another entity. The arrow indicates this field contains a reference (URN) to another entity, and the name indicates the type of relationship (e.g., `→ Contains`, `→ OwnedBy`)

Fields with complex types (like `Edge`, `AuditStamp`) link to their definitions in the [Common Types](#common-types) section below.

### Aspects

### Common Types

These types are used across multiple aspects in this entity.

#### AuditStamp

Data captured on a resource/association/sub-resource level giving insight into when that resource/association/sub-resource moved into a particular lifecycle stage, and who acted to move it into that specific lifecycle stage.

**Fields:**

- `time` (long): When did the resource/association/sub-resource move into the specific lifecyc...
- `actor` (string): The entity (e.g. a member URN) which will be credited for moving the resource...
- `impersonator` (string?): The entity (e.g. a service URN) which performs the change on behalf of the Ac...
- `message` (string?): Additional context around how DataHub was informed of the particular change. ...


### Relationships

#### Outgoing
These are the relationships stored in this entity's aspects
- ingestionSource

   - DataHubIngestionSource via `dataHubExecutionRequestInput.source.ingestionSource`
